#Building an object-oriented language Virtual Machine in 72 hours

This books was designed for developers who knows how to program in object-oriented languages but do not know how to implement an object engine (a virtual machine, an object kernel, a bytecode compiler, ...). It includes several tutorials to teach how to build a simple interpreter based virtual machine for an object-oriented language. The object-oriented language built is fairly simple. Everything is an object. The language is similar to Smalltalk or Ruby.
