Like any Smalltalk object, you can inspect or explore the ZnResponse object. You might be wondering how this response was actually transferred over the network. That is easy with Zn, as the key HTTP objects all implement \#writeOn: for this purpose.

\begin{script}{Making a connection}
| response |
response := (ZnClient new)
  url: 'http://zn.stfx.eu/zn/small.html';
  get;
  response.
response writeOn: Transcript.
Transcript flush.
\end{script}

If you have the Transcript open, you should see something like the following:
