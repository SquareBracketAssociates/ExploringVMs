Things left to implement or fix
===============================

- whole book / per chapter compilation
- book/part title pages
- colophon, foreword...
- hint paragraphs with fontawesome icons (or floats)
- check with LuLu about Distiller b0rking ligatures and vector illustrations
- normal floats for listings: normal label/caption, and use displaycode
  environments inside. This would enable to group several small listings in
  succession under a single caption, e.g. related Smalltalk methodsâ€¦
